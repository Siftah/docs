### Build website locally

You can build website locally using [Jekyll][jekyll] to see how things look like before committing change. 

Install [bundler][bundler] and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then, simply go to the root of the repository and run jekyll:

```
$ bundler exec jekyll serve
```

It will start jekyll webserver which will serve statically generated website at [http://localhost:4000/docs/](http://localhost:4000/docs/). Jekyll will watch files and regenerate website every time when there is a change.
